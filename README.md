  ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/label-MIT-green)
  ## Description 
  My assignment is to modify starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. The applicatio will then be deployed to Heroku.

  ## Installation

  To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

  nmp i

  ## Usage
  User will deplay the app [here](https://nameless-ridge-93720.herokuapp.com/). This will take them to the landing page of the app. When the 'Get Started' button is clicked, they will be redirected to the 'notes' page. Here a page is presented with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the noteâ€™s text in the right-hand column. When a new note title and text is entered, a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page. When clicked, this will make the new note appear in the left-hand column with the other existing notes. If the user clicks on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, the note appears back in the right-hand column. The write icon in the navigation at the top of the page will present the user with the ability to enter a new note title and text. The delete icon next to the added note titles will allow the user to delete unwanted notes.
